# Stock-Market-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning


This Python script is designed for performing stock market analysis using advanced machine learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The script encompasses the following key stages:

## 1. Data Collection
- **Objective**: To gather historical stock price data.
- **Method**: The script retrieves this data from Yahoo Finance, ensuring that a comprehensive dataset is available for analysis.

## 2. Data Preparation
- **Objective**: To preprocess the collected data for model training.
- **Tasks**:
  - **Feature Engineering**: Calculates essential indicators like moving averages to aid in understanding stock trends.
  - **Normalization**: Scales data to a uniform range, enhancing model performance and stability.

## 3. Model Building and Training
- **Objective**: To develop a predictive model for future stock prices.
- **Approach**:
  - Constructs an LSTM model, a type of recurrent neural network well-suited for time series prediction.
  - Trains the model using the preprocessed data to capture patterns and relationships within the stock price trends.

## 4. Evaluation
- **Objective**: To assess the accuracy of the model’s predictions.
- **Method**:
  - Compares predicted values with actual stock prices.
  - Visualizes results to provide insights into the model’s forecasting capabilities and performance.

This script leverages various Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning, creating a robust workflow for forecasting stock market trends and making informed investment decisions.
